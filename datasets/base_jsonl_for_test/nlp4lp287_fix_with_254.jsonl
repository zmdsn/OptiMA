{"description": "PROBLEM TYPE: LP\nPROBLEM INFO:\n\n- A farmer wishes to plan production on his \\var{all_space} acre farm over the next five years. \n- At present, he has a herd of 120 cows. \n- This is made up of \\var{n_heifers} heifers and \\var{n_milk} milk-producing cows. \n- Each heifer needs \\var{heifer_space} acre to support it and each dairy cow \\var{cow_space} acre. \n- A dairy cow produces an average of \\var{cow_calve} calves per year. \n- Half of these calves will be bullocks, which are sold almost immediately for an average of \\var{price_bullock} each. \n- The remaining heifers can be either sold almost immediately for \\var{price_heifer} or reared to become milk-producing cows at two years old. \n- It is intended that all dairy cows be sold at 12 years old for an average of \\var{price_cow} each, although there will probably be an annual loss of \\var{loss_heifer} per year among heifers and \\var{loss_cow} among dairy cows. \n- At present, there are 10 cows each aged from newborn to 11 years old. \n- The decision of how many heifers to sell in the current year has already been taken and implemented.\n- The milk from a cow yields an annual revenue of \\var{revenue_milk}. \n- A maximum of \\var{n_maxcow} cows can be housed at the present time. \n- To provide accommodation for each cow beyond this number will entail a capital outlay of \\var{cow_outlay} per cow. \n- Each milk- producing cow requires \\var{cow_grain} tons of grain and \\var{cow_sugar} tons of sugar beet per year. \n- Grain and sugar beet can both be grown on the farm. \n- Each acre yields \\var{sugar_per_acre} tons of sugar beet. \n- Only \\var{space_grain} acres are suitable for growing grain. \n- They can be divided into groups.\n- Group \\var{k} has space \\var{graindivision_{k}} and yields \\var{yield_{k}} tons per acre.\n- Grain can be bought for \\var{buyprice_grain} per ton and sold for \\var{sellprice_grain} per ton. \n- Sugar beet can be bought for \\var{buyprice_sugar} per ton and sold for \\var{sellprice_sugar} per ton.\n- Each heifer requires \\var{labour_heifers} hours of labour per year.\n- Each milk-producing cow requires \\var{labour_cow} hours of labour per year.\n- Each acre put into grain requires \\var{labour_grain} hours of labour per year.\n- Each acre put into sugar beet requires \\var{labour_sugar} hours of

requires \\var{extra_grain} per year.\n- Each acre put into sugar beet requires \\var{extra_sugar} per year.\n- Labour costs for the farm are at present \\var{labour_cost} per year and provide \\var{labour_hour} labour. \n- Any labour needed above this will cost \\var{extra_labour_cost} per hour.\n- Any capital expenditure would be financed by a 10-year loan at 15% annual interest. \n- The interest and capital repayment would be paid in 10 equally sized yearly installments. \n- In no year can the cash flow be negative. \n- Finally, the farmer would neither wish to reduce the total
